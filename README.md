This will install all the npm packages listed under the dependencies in the package.json.(MySQL, express, express-handlebars, Node) Then you will open  MySQLworkbench and copy the data in schema.sql file in a SQL file. Once you click on the execute button database table is created for you locally. Then you will open terminal again and type the command ``` node server.js```. This will connect the server. Finally you will type ```localhost:8085``` in the browserwindow and use the application. If you would like to make changes to the application code files , you will have to restart the server after each change.
